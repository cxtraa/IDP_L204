TO DO:
- Manual Control:
    - Abstract control of each of three motors (incl. one servo)
    - Abstract control of colour sensor, grouped IR sensors, and LED
- Automated Control:
    - Line tracking algorithm (done?)
    - Represent the map as a graph
        - Vertices are junctions on the map
        - Edges are slightly irrelevant, we can use the coordinates to determine direction
        - E.g. (0, 0) -> (1, 0) is clearly "go right"
    - Find the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm
    
    - robot.forward() sends robot forward until it meets a new junction
    - robot.turn_right() rotates robot clockwise 90 deg
    - robot.turn_left() rotates robot anti-clockwise 90 deg
    - robot must keep track of its own orientation

Notes:
- Empirical largest spacing of tracking sensors such that two sensors can both detect the line ~1.8 cm
- Should classes be in separate files or together?

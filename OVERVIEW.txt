TO DO:
- Manual Control:
    - Abstract control of each of three motors (incl. one servo)
    - Abstract control of colour sensor, grouped IR sensors, and LED
- Automated Control:
    - Line tracking algorithm

Notes:
- Empirical largest spacing of tracking sensors such that two sensors can both detect the line ~1.8 cm
- Should classes be in separate files or together?
